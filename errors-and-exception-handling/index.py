# Erros and exception in Python.

#  We could get error in python because of writing wrong syntax.

# We also can get exceptions if: basically exceptions are logic based where syntax is worrect but logic  isn't.


                                            # Types of Errors.

    # 1. Syntax Error : 

# example : 1.
# where, I'm writing for loop wrongly.
# for :

# example: 2.
# There, I'm writing if condition wrongly.
# if :



    # 2. Type Error : 
# print("2" + 2);

    # 3. Name Error: In case, if we are trying to use a varibale which is not defined or any defined entity wrongly.
    # like -- { print = prinp} ---> NameError.
    # like -- { range = ranpe} ---> NameError.

# print(a);

    # 4. Indentation Error: In Case, if proper spacing is not maintained between single or multiple lines of code.

    # 5. ZeroDivisionError: In case, if we divide any number with zero we goona get this error. which is logically not true.
# print(15/0);


    # there are other many more types of errors.
    # we find we can use this.
# print((dir(__builtins__)));
