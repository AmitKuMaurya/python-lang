# Oops.
    # A class has attributes and behaviours.
    #  what is class ?

    # A class is a template and blueprint to create objects.

# item1 = "IPhone";
# item1_price = 100;
# item1_quantity = 5;
# item_total_price = item1_price * item1_quantity;

# class Item :
#     pass;

# item1 = Item()
# item1.name = "IPhone"
# item1.price = 100 
# # random_

# objects rae real workd entities.
    # car, bus , tickets, banks.

# classes are blueprint of creating objects, once
    # example : once a human class is created we could add multiple human from that.

# we need class to complile huge data under a single hood of class.


# 1: Abstraction.
    # abstraction means displying only essentials information and hinding the details.
    # example: car will accelerate but internal working is not eposed.
    # example : you have food in restraunts. but never know how it's prepared.


# 2. Encapsulation
    # building of data into a single unit.
    # bundling of all methods that can act on an object of that data.
    # cr cn have color, brake, engine and a lot of other methods

# 3 : Inheritance
    # when a class derives from another class.
    # any new car company can inherit all the information from car class

# 4 : Polmorphism.
    # the word polymorphism means having many forms.
    # same class method can work diffrenetly for different objects.

    # lt's say there is an class.
        # which has speaking object
            # And this property may work different for different people.
            # russia speaks : russian, indian speaks : hindi(majorly).
